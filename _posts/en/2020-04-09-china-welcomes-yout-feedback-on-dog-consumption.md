Is there a way to finally ban consumption of dog meat in China? At the moment of writing this article I live in China for about three years, rough estimate if we sum up all of my shorter stays. I am well aware of cruel practices of dog slaughter in Mainland China, although apart from maybe occasionally seeing a dog in a cage, unclear if for consumption or not, I have not witnessed this practice in person.

I am involved in local animal rescue practices, and I avoid travelling around China as my network of veterinary doctors is limited to Shanghai, during my travel, I do not want to risk encountering an injured dog or cat in distress without being able to provide help.

There is an open debate on if dog meat consumption should be forbidden or not, some people raise an important question why dogs life should be protected more than, for instance pigs life or cows life. There is a strong logical and ethical point in this argument, however what I mainly oppose is not consumption of dog meat itself, but the extremely cruel way it is organised. I will save you the gore details of the practice, as you could research it by yourself, and this article is meant to be brief and solution oriented.

Today an announcement has been published on the [official website of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of People's Republic of China](http://www.moa.gov.cn/hd/zqyj/202004/t20200408_6341067.htm), representing a request for opinions on matter of animal consumption.

In accordance with regulations regarding the Prohibition of Illegal Wildlife Trade, the Elimination of the Abuse of Wild Animals and the Safeguarding of the People’s Health and Safety, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People’s Republic of China published a draft which lays out the kinds of animals allowed to be bred for meat, fur or medical uses.

In the attached document, item No. 5 attracts my attention. It specifically noted the omission of dogs for meat, pointing out that dogs should be treated as human companions, and as internationally they are not raised as food - in China they also should not be regarded as food.

The Government of People's Republic of China is requesting the public to provide feedback on this matter and lists available channels of communication, one of them being the e-mail address <zysxzc@agri.gov.cn>. It is not specified if everyone's opinions are welcome, or only Chinese Citizens, thus let us assume we can all message them with our approbation of this initiative.

The quoted text from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People’s Republic of China translates into the following.

> Regarding the dogs. As human civilisation advances and the Public leans towards the protection of animals, dogs earned a special role as our companions. On international scale, dog is not an animal meant for consumption as food, and in China it should not be either.

> ~ Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of People’s Republic of China, "National Catalog of Animal Genetic Resources", April 9, 2020

This it is the Government's initiative, thus chances of them taking into account your opinion on this matter are much greater than in case of signing a regular online petition. With help of my friends who are Chinese speakers, I drafter a short e-mail content you can use to contact the listed above address.
